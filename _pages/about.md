**Hi, I'm Vishnu!** I'm a dedicated Data Scientist with a passion for leveraging machine learning, advanced data analytics, and big data technologies to uncover insights from complex datasets and transform them into actionable strategies.

üéì I hold a **Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science** from the University of Alabama (graduated May 2024). During my time there, I contributed to various impactful projects. As a Graduate Research Assistant at the Alabama Water Institute, I enhanced data processing workflows for the National Snow Model, **increasing efficiency by 25%**. My work on developing a **ML-based snow model** using CNN and LSTM improved Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) precision by 15%. This research was published and presented at the AGU Conference, and you can find the abstract [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AGUFM.C51D0971C/abstract). Additionally, I developed a comprehensive **data retrieval and processing pipeline** for NSMv2.0, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/whitelightning450/SWEML).

At the Alabama Transportation Institute üöó, I contributed to traffic safety initiatives by analyzing **Alabama crash records** and the public perception on **Short Term effects of Autonomous Vehicles** post incidents. By utilizing Python, Apache Spark, and SQL, I achieved a 10x improvement in processing efficiency on extensive taffic data. üíº During my tenure as a Data Scientist Intern, I created data cleaning pipelines using Pandas and other advanced algorithms, also includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **dynamic visualizations and dashboards** in Tableau and Python, boosting insights. I also assisted in model development using PyTorch, where advanced feature engineering techniques helped enhance model accuracy by 20%. My contributions to designing and implementing Spark jobs were instrumental in improving data transformation workflows.

I am currently exploring the latest trends in AI, focusing on cutting-edge technologies and frameworks like **LangChain, LangGraphs, MLOPs and MLflow** to harness the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for various use cases and product development and deployement. My technical expertise spans across Generative AI, Python, and big data tools such as Apache Spark and Airflow. I leverage both relational and non-relational databases to perform complex data transformations, ensuring robust and scalable solutions. 

Additionally, I hold multiple certifications in Data Science and AI field that includes **Microsoft Certified Azure Data Engineer Associate** [credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/VishnuSaiKarthikGindi-3535/4F8D3C0FE3400207?sharingId=46CF6B4AB103184B), demonstrating my proficiency in cloud platforms like Azure and Google Cloud. From designing intelligent chatbots and recommendation engines to building intricate data pipelines, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of AI and transforming data into actionable insights.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about the projects I've worked on and the innovative solutions I've developed. Let‚Äôs connect and collaborate! ü§ù
