**I'm Vishnu!** I'm a **Data Scientist** passionate about transforming data into actionable insights through cutting-edge AI and Big data technologies. My expertise spans the entire ML lifecycle, from model development to deployment in the cloud, ensuring robust and scalable solutions.

🎓 I earned my **Master’s in Computer Science** in May 2024. As a Research Assistant, I engineered and deployed complex ML solutions such as a **CNN-based snow model**, improving Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) prediction accuracy by 15%. My work also optimized the **National Snow Model’s data pipeline**, boosting processing efficiency by 25%,  which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/whitelightning450/SWEML). I showcased these findings at the AGU Conference—check out the abstract [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AGUFM.C51D0971C/abstract).

🚗 At the Alabama Transportation Institute, I applied ML techniques, such as **Decision Trees**, and **CNNs**, to analyze over 200,000 traffic crash records. Conducted end to end **sentiment analysis** on public perception of autonomous vehicles after viral incidents using finetuned **RoBERTa transformer**, **web scraping**, and **statistical evaluation**. I also enhanced real-time traffic analytics using **Apache Spark**, improving **ETL pipeline** scalability and processing speeds by 2x.
 
🔧 As a Data Scientist Intern, I built **containerized applications** using **Flask** and **Docker** to showcase ML models, integrating them with **REST APIs** for seamless demos. I also deployed these models on **Google Cloud**, making them accessible and scalable. My work on model evaluation using **PyTorch** and advanced algorithms pushed the accuracy of fraud detection systems by 20%. I also assisted in model development and evaluation using PyTorch and various metrics, where advanced feature engineering techniques helped enhance model accuracy by 20%. My contributions to designing and implementing Spark jobs were instrumental in improving data transformation workflows.

🚀 I am actively exploring **MLOps** practices with tools like **MLflow**, **Dagshub** and GenAI frameworks like **Langchain** and **Llama-index** to ensure smooth deployment of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This includes advanced containerization, continuous integration (CI/CD), and cloud-based monitoring to support enterprise-grade solutions. 

🔍 Some exciting GenAI projects I'm working on include:

**TravelGPT** 🛫: A **multi-agent chatbot** designed for handling travel queries, particularly across regions in India. It employs **hierarchical indexing retrieval strategies** and LangChain to optimize response accuracy. It’s a fully functional **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** model integrated with travel APIs for broader functionalities.

**Medical Record Search Engine** 🏥: A powerful RAG-based engine built using **Neo4j and LLMs**, designed to enhance healthcare by offering precise medical records retrieval. This system integrates knowledge graphs for context-aware searching, doubling data retrieval efficiency.

Additionally, I hold multiple certifications, including being a **Microsoft Certified Azure Data Engineer Associate** [credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/VishnuSaiKarthikGindi-3535/4F8D3C0FE3400207?sharingId=46CF6B4AB103184B) and MLOps course. With a solid foundation in machine learning and cloud platforms like Azure and Google Cloud, I build ML pipelines that are scalable, cloud-deployable, and production-ready.
