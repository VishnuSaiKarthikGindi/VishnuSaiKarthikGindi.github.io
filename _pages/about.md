I am **Vishnu**, a passionate Data Scientist 🧠 with a strong foundation in machine learning, advanced data analytics, and big data technologies. My journey in data science has been driven by my enthusiasm for uncovering insights from complex datasets 📊 and transforming them into actionable strategies 🚀.

🎓 I graduated with Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Alabama in May 2024, where I have contributed to enhancing data processing efficiency ⚡ and predictive accuracy 🔮. As a Graduate Research Assistant at the Alabama Water Institute, I designed a data processing workflow for the National Snow Model, boosting efficiency by 25%. My work included developing an ML-based snow model using CNN and LSTM, which improved SWE precision by 15% and was published and presented at the AGU Conference [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AGUFM.C51D0971C/abstract). I also developed a complete data retrieval and processing pipeline for NSMv2.0, available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/whitelightning450/SWEML). At the Alabama Transportation Institute, I empowered traffic safety initiatives by analyzing over 200,000 crash records and using Apache Spark to achieve a 10x enhancement in processing efficiency 🚗. 

💼 My professional toolkit includes Python, relational and non-relational databases, Apache Spark ⚙️, and cloud platforms like Azure ☁️ and Google Cloud. I specialize in scalable solutions, from creating chatbots using advanced algorithms to building recommendation engines 🎯 and designing complex data pipelines 🛠️. Constantly pushing the boundaries of AI with latest technologies, I am passionate about transforming data into actionable intelligence 🌟.
