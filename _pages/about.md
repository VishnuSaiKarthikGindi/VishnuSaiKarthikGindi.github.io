**Hi, I'm Vishnu!** I'm a dedicated Data Scientist with a passion for leveraging machine learning, advanced data analytics, and big data technologies to uncover insights from complex datasets and transform them into actionable strategies.

🎓 I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Alabama (graduated May 2024). During my time there, I contributed to various impactful projects. As a Graduate Research Assistant at the Alabama Water Institute, I enhanced data processing workflows for the National Snow Model, increasing efficiency by 25%. My work on developing a machine learning-based snow model using CNN and LSTM improved Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) precision by 15%. This research was published and presented at the AGU Conference, and you can find the abstract [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AGUFM.C51D0971C/abstract). Additionally, I developed a comprehensive data retrieval and processing pipeline for NSMv2.0, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/whitelightning450/SWEML).

At the Alabama Transportation Institute, I contributed to traffic safety initiatives by analyzing alabama crash records and analyzed both short and long term effects of Autonomous Vehicles towards public. By utilizing Python, Apache Spark and SQL, I achieved a 10x improvement in processing efficiency 🚗.

💼 My technical expertise includes Python, relational and non-relational databases, Apache Spark, and cloud platforms like Azure and Google Cloud. I specialize in creating scalable solutions, from designing chatbots with advanced algorithms to building recommendation engines and complex data pipelines. I am always eager to push the boundaries of AI with the latest technologies and transform data into actionable intelligence.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about the projects I've worked on and the innovative solutions I've developed. Let’s connect and collaborate! 🤝
