## Dataset: 
The model is trained on the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains real-world transaction data. The dataset is preprocessed and normalized to improve model performance. Credit card fraud detection is a crucial application in financial services. The primary challenge is the **imbalanced nature of the data**, where fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to true ones. This project leverages an **LSTM Autoencoder** to address this challenge by focusing on the sequential patterns in the transaction data.

### Model Architecture:
Model consists of an Encoder and Decoder with LSTM layers, allowing it to learn the temporal dependencies in transaction sequences. The Encoder compresses the input sequence into a lower-dimensional representation, and the Decoder attempts to reconstruct the original sequence from this compressed form. The model is trained on normal transactions, and during inference, it reconstructs incoming transactions. Transactions with **high reconstruction errors are flagged as anomalies** (potential frauds).

## Results:
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve, which are suitable for imbalanced datasets. The LSTM Autoencoder model demonstrated a significant ability to detect fraudulent transactions by learning patterns in normal transactions and identifying deviations from these patterns with an **accuracy of 95%**. The attention to sequence dependencies in the data allowed the model to outperform traditional anomaly detection techniques.
