In this project, I developed a **Customer Support Chatbot** using deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on incorporating an attention mechanism within a sequence-to-sequence model. The chatbot was trained on a custom dataset of daily conversational dialogues, simulating the type of interactions commonly encountered in customer support scenarios.

**Data Preparation:**  
The data was cleaned and tokenized, and special start (`<sos>`) and end (`<eos>`) tokens were added to each dialogue sequence to help the model understand the beginning and end of a conversation. 

**Model Development:**  
The model architecture is based on the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) framework with an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when predicting the next word, making it particularly effective for handling long conversations where some parts of the input may be more relevant than others. The encoder processes the input question, and the decoder generates the response, using the context vector enhanced by attention weights to predict each word in the response.

Model employed beam search during the inference phase to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses. This approach significantly outperformed traditional greedy decoding methods. Traditional Seq2Seq models without attention often struggle with long or complex sequences, as they compress the entire input sequence into a fixed-length context vector. This can lead to information loss, especially in conversations that require understanding nuances or remembering details from earlier in the conversation.
