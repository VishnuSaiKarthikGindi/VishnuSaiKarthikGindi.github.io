**Data Used and Processing:**
The data used for this project includes a large dataset of facial expressions along with a **curated database(Processed using PostgreSQL)** of songs categorized by the emotions they evoke obtained using **Spotify API**. The facial expression data was processed using **OpenCV** for real-time facial detection, and the emotions were classified using a **fine-tuned VGG layers**. The songs were stored in a PostgreSQL database for faster retrieval, organized by emotion categories, making it easy to query and fetch relevant songs.

**Model Development and Deployment:**
The model for emotion detection was developed using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of a **multiple VGG layers including Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers**, optimized using the Adam optimizer. The model was trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**, a widely recognized dataset for facial emotion recognition, which contains thousands of labeled images spanning seven emotional categories. After training, the model was integrated into a **Flask** web application that captures live video feed, detects emotions in real-time, and recommends songs accordingly via interactive UI.

Traditional music recommendation systems rely heavily on user inputs, such as past listening history or manual mood selection. Emotify, however, **automatically detects the user's emotional state through facial recognition**, providing a more intuitive and personalized music recommendation experience. This approach eliminates the need for users to manually input their emotions, offering a seamless and engaging interaction.

Emotify's emotion detection model achieved an accuracy of **approximately 80% on the test set**, which is a strong performance given the complexity of facial emotion recognition. The recommendation system has been tested with friends, showing a high level of satisfaction and relevance in the music choices provided.
