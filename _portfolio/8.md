**Data Collection**: 
**Twitter API with Tweepy** was employed to scrape tweets related to autonomous vehicles.
**BeautifulSoup** was utilized to scrape news articles published around the time of the incidents.
Additional sentiment data was sourced from **Sprinklr** to enrich the analysis.

**Data Processing**:
Raw data was cleaned extensively to remove noise, ensuring relevance by categorizing content based on keywords directly related to autonomous vehicle incidents and the entire processing pipeline was managed using **Apache Spark**, facilitating efficient handling of large volumes of text data.

**Sentiment Analysis**:
Sentiment analysis was performed using a **pretrained transformer model** from Hugging Face's **RoBERTa**.
Additionally, traditional sentiment analysis models such as **VADER** and **TextBlob** from **NLTK** were used to provide comparative insights.
The models assessed the sentiment polarity and subjectivity, offering a comprehensive view of public reactions.
The results were visualized using **Python** libraries, including **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, to illustrate trends over time and compare sentiments across different platforms (news vs. social media).

The project reveals how public sentiment evolves following autonomous vehicle incidents and highlights differences in immediate versus long-term reactions. These insights can be crucial for policymakers and companies involved in autonomous vehicle technology.
